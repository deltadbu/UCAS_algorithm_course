## Algorithm Course of UCAS 

Several challenging questions are arising now: 

- How does algorithm design change in the era of AI?
- How to design AI models or LLMs for algorithm design?
- Will algorithm design techniques still be necessary for CS students when algorithmic LLMs are available?

I want to investigate these questions in this course.
